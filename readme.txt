Experiment to see how easy it is to write a small GTK utility in
Python. 

Once executed a magnifying glass should appear in the system
tray. Clicking on it will list all the current windows that can be
toggled into fullscreen.

This doesn't really add any new functionality (GNOME already provides
the option of assigning a shortcut key to fullscreen toggle), but the
GUI setup code could prove useful in future.
